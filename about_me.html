            Hey!! Look who's here &#128516;. This page will tell you more about me and give you a sneak peek into my life.<br>
            Alright on with my introduction then (drumroll&#129345;...). 
        </p>
        <p class="fs-3">
            My name is Suryansh Chandola. I am from Uttarakhand, India. I am in my junior year of college pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I am somewhat of an "extroverted introvert" since I do like interacting with people but end up spending a lot of time in my room instead! You may be curious about this controversial behaviour. Well that's where a very core foundation of my personality kicks in. My being is built upon the idea of discipline and the thinking that "what needs to be done has to be done"(especially in terms of work). This work-oriented mind of mine makes the embrace of the study table seem ever so enticing and alluring. Being honest, I am somewhat slow in all aspects of my life like eating(friends and family can vouch for it), brushing my teeth etc. But hey! Slow and steady wins the race right.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-3">What do I do in my free time? I like playing the guitar(I have a grade 2 certification in plectrum-style guitar from the Trinity School of Music) and it has been one of my favourite pastimes ever since I started playing it. I mostly play songs from the J-pop genre and am finally at a stage where I can play moderately difficult songs by ear(currently trying to learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VKIqrvVOpo&ab_channel=%E3%83%A8%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B7%E3%82%AB%2Fn-bunaOfficial">"Tada Kimi ni Hare"</a> by Yorushika). I mostly listen to youtube guitarists such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mukuchichan">Mukuchi-chan</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChakiP">ChakiP</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ichika_nito">Ichika Nito</a>. Music is an integral part of my life and I like singing too(proud bathroom singer). Oh! I also play rhythm games like <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home">osu!</a>(country ranking 3,354)
        </p>
        <p class="fs-3">
            I have been fortunate enough to learn a variety of sports as a child and am confident in my skills(not a pro but better than average). Out of all sports basketball is my favourite. I've watched my fair share of NBA and you can think of me as a typical Curry fanboy(I throw the ball from half court in hopes of making a shot! Although Kobe is the player I learnt a lot from). However, I feel that I'd rather the game myself than watch others playing it.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-3">
            I also meditate in my free time. I try to start my mornings with 10-15 minute meditation sessions everyday(big thank you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@omswamitv">Om Swami</a>). This is probably one of the most constructive things I do for myself. Meditating for some time gives me such peace of mind and clarity of thought. It makes me mindful of myself and those around me and I often end up being more productive.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-3">
            Alright it's time to confess now...I am a big fan of Japanese animation cartoons or "anime" as people might know them. I have watched a LOT of anime(favourite anime is Gintama). 
            especially during the lockdown period which I refer to as the "Rise of The Weeb Within". I am a nerd when it comes to japanese voice actors or "seiyuu" as they call them in japan(another feat achieved during the lockdown period. My favourite voice actors include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomokazu_Sugita">Sugita Tomkazu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayane_Sakura">Sakura Ayane</a>). Due to this insane love for anime I even spent some time learning Japanese on my own(Nihongo wa muzukashii! &#128534;).
