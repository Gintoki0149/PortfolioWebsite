              <p class="card-text fs-5">My first Machine Learning project!! I implemented some basic algorithms like Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Polynomial Regression using L1 and L2 Regularization from scratch. I used numpy to create my own dataset based on a known function(eg. y = x1 + x2 for gradient descent). This was the first time I used object oriented programming in Python for an actual project. I gained an insight into hyper-parameter tuning and the importance of scaling the input. After this project I was able to truly appreciate the math behind these algorithms. It was a lot of fun plotting the results of my model and even comparing the results with popular libraries.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">This is a native android application made using Android Studio and Java for renting houses and putting houses up for rent. This was the first time I made an android application with Firebase. The application includes features such as adding a new property for rent, requesting a property for renting, managing rent requests for properties owned by a user. This project made me comfortable working with Firebase Auth, Firebase Realtime Database, working with recycler views in Android Studio and making custom adapters for them, card views and NoSQL. It was interesting to think about how to tackle multiple users trying to rent the same property at the same time.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">This was a task assigned to me during my first internship which was at Jio Platforms Ltd, Hyderabad. The task was to make a preview screen for a video-conferencing application. I used Angular to make the layout.I used ng directives in a project for the first time. I had implemented video-sharing and screen-share features. Using the EventEmitter and creating custom event handlers was quite engaging.</p>

              <p class="card-text fs-5">The first projects I made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. Some of the earlier tasks I got while working as an intern in Jio Platforms Ltd, Hyderabad. I made a simple calculator application and a user-registration form. It was amazing to see how easily beautiful and responsive layouts could be made using Bootstrap, especially when the alternative to making webpages for different screen sizes was media-queries. Coding out the form-verification functions in Javascript was pretty fun.<br>
              Fun Fact: This was the first time I hosted anything on GitHub Pages.</p>
